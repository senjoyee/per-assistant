# React Application

This README provides instructions on how to set up, install dependencies, and run this React application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server:

If you're using npm:
```
npm run dev
```

If you're using yarn:
```
yarn dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
